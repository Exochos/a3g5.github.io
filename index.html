							<h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
							<p class="major">
			Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science which enables computer systems to learn and perform tasks normally associated with human intellect. 
			These tasks include speech recognition, decision-making, and visual perception. Most industries work with vast amounts of data and are quickly incorporating 
			machine learning technology. This turn to automation helps them to work more efficiently and gain an advantage over their competitors. Some of the industries that are 
			using such methods include Financial Services, Health Care, Retail, Oil and Gas, and Transportation, to name a few.

							<h2>The Benefits of AI</h2>
							
							<article>
								<p>The benefits of AI are evident in the ways that we've seen advances in the technology applied. “AI powers many programs and services that help us do everyday things such as connecting with friends, using an email program, or using a ride-share service. If you have reservations about the use of artificial intelligence, it may be comforting to know that most of us have been using AI on a daily basis for many years” <a href="http://medium.com/@the_manifest/16-examples-of-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-your-everyday-life-655b2e6a49de" target="_blank">(The Manifest, 2018)</a> . Understanding how AI is used in daily life can help you decide for yourself if AI is beneficial. </p>
								<p>Some of the ways we use AI include:</p>

							<h2>Using AI to Refine Business Processes</h2>
							
							<article>
								<p>Artificial Intelligence is rapidly changing the way business processes are performed today. This increased level of automation streamlines day-to-day operations and in turn, increases business profitability. </p>
								<p>Some examples in automation of administrative tasks in the workplace looks like:</p>
								<ul class="actions stacked">
									<li>Improving team meetings by using voice assistants to schedule and record meetings </li>
									<li>Voice assistant technology capable of capturing key highlights and actions by creating and sharing actionable notes following the meeting</li>
									<li>Customer service-centric ability to capture client calls, transcribe the entire conversations, and automatically summarize key items and actions</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Improve the Quality of Customer and Employee Experience</h3>
								<p>AI also has the capability of analyzing call center calls for quality of service. It can even detect inappropriate and problematic customer service with more than twice the accuracy of a voice recognition system. In HR, AI can create online platforms capable of conducting initial interviews of candidates in their own homes. According to Unilever, around 70,000 person-hours of interviewing and assessing candidates have been cut thanks to the automated screening of candidates. These streamlining improvements leave your employees free to collaborate and innovate in their teams. </p>

							<h2>AI Accuracy Continues to Improve</h2>
							<p>The quality of information available is often a barrier to businesses and organizations wanting to move towards AI-driven, automated decision-making. But as technology and methods of simulating real-world processes and mechanisms in the digital domain have improved over recent years, accurate data has become increasingly available. </p>
							<h3>Saving Money with Simulations</h3>
							<p>Simulations have advanced to the stage where car manufacturers and others working on the development of autonomous vehicles can gain thousands of hours of driving data without vehicles even leaving the lab, leading to huge reductions in cost as well as increases in the quality of data that can be gathered. This decade will see an increase in the accuracy and availability of real-world simulations, which in turn will lead to more powerful and accurate AI.</p>
							<h3>AI is Here to Help</h3>
							<p>In this new decade, the cost of hardware and software will continue to fall and AI tools will increasingly be embedded into our vehicles, household appliances, and workplace tools. You can see it in home security systems by Ring, Nest, and Arlo. AI has been implanted in Tesla's Autopilot System in their automobiles while other auto manufacturers also have some form of it in their own products.
							</p>
							<p>Artificial Intelligence will be aided by technology such as virtual and augmented reality displays, and combined with paradigms like the cloud and Internet of Things, this decade will see more and more devices of every shape and size starting to think and learn for themselves.</p>
